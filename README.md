# keyacid

Secure and easy crypto for everyone!

## Introduction

Keyacid is an offline crypto program inspired by [keybase](https://keybase.io). Given that keybase stores its users' private key in its server, it should not be considered secure. Thus, I wrote keyacid to make encryption and decryption completely offline.

## Dependencies
